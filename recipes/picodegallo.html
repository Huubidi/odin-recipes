    <h4>A refreshing bowl of goodness!</h4>
    <p>The secret to this recipe is the use of white wine vinegar, which brings some extra-refreshing zestiness to your salsa.</p>
    <p>With the help of the whole family, you'll have yourself a heaping pile of pico de gallo in no time. Little sister can core the tomatoes, while junior dices them up. Dad can dice the onions and garlic, and mom can handle the herbs and chili. Then, everyone simply adds their creation to the same bowl. Remember to season!</p>

    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>7 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or fresh coriander</li>
        <li>Fresh chilies</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>White wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>


    <ol><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>Core your tomatoes so that only the outer shell is remaining. Make sure you get all the seeds out.</li>
        <li>Dice the tomatoes into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Dice the red onion into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Finely dice the garlic. Do not use a garlic press, instead practice your knife skills.</li>
        <li>Cut the lime into halfs.</li>
        <li>Shred the parsley into small particles using your knife.</li>
        <li>Slice the chilies into tiny pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the diced tomato, diced red onion, diced garlic, sliced chilies and shredded parsley into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of the two halves of lime into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour about a table spoon of olive oil into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour two teaspoons of white wine vinegar into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add about a teaspoon of salt into the bowl, and grind pepper to taste into the bowl as well.</li>
        <li>Mix everything up using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! I personally enjoy this on chicken tacos.</li>
