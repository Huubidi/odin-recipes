<h4 class="kskills">Knife skills</h4>
<p class="knifeskills"><span class="b4chop"><strong>Before you get to choppin',</strong></span> I recommend watching this short video on basic knife skills. Additionally, remember to sharpen your knife before beginning, as that will lessen the pressure you have to put on the blade. The less force you need to use, the less likely you are to hurt yourself. Cutting is a lot harder with a dull knife, and cooking is a lot less fun with a bandage on your finger.</p>
