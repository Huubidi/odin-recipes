    <h4>The end product!</h4>
    <p>This easy recipe will make sure your breakfast keeps the hunger away for a long time!</p>
    <p>The best part is that you get to eat what you make!</p>

    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Tablespoon of butter</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Finely chopped chives for garnish</li>
        <li>1 dl of milk (preferably whole milk)</li>
    </ul>


    <ol><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>Break your four eggs into a bowl, and add the dl of milk into the bowl as well.</li>
        <li>Mix up the eggs and the milk.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper to taste into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Put your frying pan on low heat.</li>
        <li>Place the tablespoon of butter into the pan and let it melt.</li>
        <li>Pour your egg-milk mixture into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Begin dragging your spatula (I prefer using a flat wooden mixer for this as it doesn't scrape the pan) through the mixture from side to side. You can think of this process as if you were slicing up a pizza into six slices.</li>
        <li>The mixture will begin to coagulate into more solid chunks. The mixture will begin sticking to the pan. Simply keep scraping the material sticking to the pan into a nice pile in the middle of the pan. This is your scramble forming.</li>
        <li>Simply keep doing this process until your scramble reaches the consistency you yourself enjoy eating the most. Some like it creamier, others like it more on the solid side.</li>
        <li>Take your pan off the heat, and put your scrambled eggs on a plate.</li>
        <li>While the eggs cool off for a little bit, chop up some chives.</li>
        <li>Garnish your scramble with the chopped chives and enjoy a hearty breakfast!</li>
    </ol>
