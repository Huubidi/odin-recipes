    <h4>The end product!</h4>
    <p>TThe secret to this recipe is the use of white wine vinegar, which brings some extra refreshing zestiness to your salsa.</p>
    <p>The best part is that you get to eat what you make!</p>

    <ul><strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>7 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 lime</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or fresh coriander</li>
        <li>Fresh chilies</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>White wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>


    <ol><strong>Steps:</strong>
        <li>Core your tomatoes so that only the outer shell is remaining. Make sure you get all the seeds out.</li>
        <li>Dice the tomatoes into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Dice the red onion into small pieces.</li>
        <li>Finely dice the garlic. Do not use a garlic press, instead practice your knife skills.</li>
        <li>Cut the lime into halfs.</li>
        <li>Shred the parsley into small particles using your knife.</li>
        <li>Slice the chilies into tiny pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the diced tomato, diced red onion, diced garlic, sliced chilies and shredded parsley into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the juice of the two halves of lime into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour about a table spoon of olive oil into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour two teaspoons of white wine vinegar into the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add about a teaspoon of salt into the bowl, and grind pepper to taste into the bowl as well.</li>
        <li>Mix everything up using a spoon.</li>
        <li>Enjoy! I personally enjoy this on chicken tacos.</li>
